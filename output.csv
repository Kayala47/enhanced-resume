Our experts generalize mission problems, advance the scientific state-of-the-art to solve the problem, and work with other NSA organizations to get solutions in front of mission users and decision-makers. NSA research activities have saved lives, and they continue to make the U.S. and its allies safer and more secure. In addition to working closely with mission partners, our researchers also collaborate regularly with the scientific community, academia, industry, and other government laboratories; publish papers on unclassified aspects of our work in scientific journals and at conferences; transfer NSA technology to the marketplace through open source software releases and public-private partnerships; serve as faculty members at local universities; and participate in university and K-12 STEM outreach activities across the country. Unlike other research facilities, NSA laboratories are funded internally, which allows our researchers to spend their time conducting research rather than writing proposals. Specifically NSA is interested in applicants conducting research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, human-machine teaming, novel architectures, cybersecurity, software reverse engineering, computer vision, and computational linguistics. Successful candidates should have demonstrated success in conducting Computer Science research and a proven track record of turning research ideas into running prototype-grade systems. As a Research Scientist, other responsibilities may include: - Conducting scientific experiments, documenting results, and communicating with colleagues, customers, and decision makers - Training, testing, and deploying machine learning models - Applying software engineering principles to design and/or develop software applications - Designing and optimizing algorithms, data structures, modeling, and analytics to solve real-world scientific problems - Using principles, techniques, procedures, and tools to architect and facilitate the development of hardware solutions - Developing methods and applications for tools to exploit and analyze computer systems and network vulnerabilities"

-1,-1,"The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect the nation. Our mission requires a strong offense and steadfast defense. The offense collects and processes foreign signals, and disseminates vital information for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents and eradicates cyber threats to U.S. national security systems and critical infrastructure. The tremendous complexity of NSA's mission requires world-class researchers, scientists, programmers and engineers who work in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, hardware and software reverse engineering, information technology infrastructure, data science, software engineering, architectures, computer security and networking, among others. NSA researchers invent and design new approaches to computing technology and find innovative uses for existing technology, ultimately providing technical capabilities necessary to execute the Agency's critical mission. Description of Position NSA Researcher Scientists are actively expanding the boundaries of what can be accomplished with artificial intelligence, machine learning, human-machine teaming, software reverse engineering, and high performance computing. Our experts generalize mission problems, advance the scientific state-of-the-art to solve the problem, and work with other NSA organizations to get solutions in front of mission users and decision-makers. NSA research activities have saved lives, and they continue to make the U.S. and its allies safer and more secure. In addition to working closely with mission partners, our researchers also collaborate regularly with the scientific community, academia, industry, and other government laboratories; publish papers on unclassified aspects of our work in scientific journals and at conferences; transfer NSA technology to the marketplace through open source software releases and public-private partnerships; serve as faculty members at local universities; and participate in university and K-12 STEM outreach activities across the country. Unlike other research facilities, NSA laboratories are funded internally, which allows our researchers to spend their time conducting research rather than writing proposals.

-1,-1,"The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect the nation. Our mission requires a strong offense and steadfast defense. The offense collects and processes foreign signals, and disseminates vital information for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents and eradicates cyber threats to U.S. national security systems and critical infrastructure. The tremendous complexity of NSA's mission requires world-class researchers, scientists, programmers and engineers who work in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, hardware and software reverse engineering, information technology infrastructure, data science, software engineering, architectures, computer security and networking, among others. NSA researchers invent and design new approaches to computing technology and find innovative uses for existing technology, ultimately providing technical capabilities necessary to execute the Agency's critical mission. Description of Position NSA Researcher Scientists are actively expanding the boundaries of what can be accomplished with artificial intelligence, machine learning, human-machine teaming, software reverse engineering, and high performance computing. Our experts generalize mission problems, advance the scientific state-of-the-art to solve the problem, and work with other NSA organizations to get solutions in front of mission users and decision-makers. NSA research activities have saved lives, and they continue to make the U.S. and its allies safer and more secure. In addition to working closely with mission partners, our researchers also collaborate regularly with the scientific community, academia, industry, and other government laboratories; publish papers on unclassified aspects of our work in scientific journals and at conferences; transfer NSA technology to the marketplace through open source software releases and public-private partnerships; serve as faculty members at local universities; and participate in university and K-12 STEM outreach activities across the country. Unlike other research facilities, NSA laboratories are funded internally, which allows our researchers to spend their time conducting research rather than writing proposals. Specifically NSA is interested in applicants conducting research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, data science, human-machine teaming, novel architectures, cybersecurity, software reverse engineering, computer vision, and computational linguistics. Successful candidates should have demonstrated success in conducting Computer Science research and a proven track record of turning research ideas into running prototype-grade systems.
