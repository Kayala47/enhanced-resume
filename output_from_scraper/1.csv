ACG Research has developed a unique Business Analytics Engine (BAE) that is
used for business modeling and economic analysis of IT systems that include
networks, data centers, cloud, and edge computing. The primary role of the
Network Modeling Engineer is to use the BAE to work with customers to build
business models. The BAE has a highly intuitive visual interface that creates
economic models by connecting model components. The Network Modeling Engineer
must work closely with ACG’s customers to understand the objectives of the
modeling exercise and understand the dynamics of the systems being modeled.
