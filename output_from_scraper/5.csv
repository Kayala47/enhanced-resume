The AAM Group,Web Developer - Full-Stack/PHP/JavaScript/React Programming,Bristol,"The AAM Group’s Web Developers and Junior Developers are web-based programmers
working in PHP, JavaScript, and React, that are responsible for helping to
build web-based software that is used by our stakeholders. They work alongside
AAM’s team of programmers to help build and develop our next big idea as well
as helping to maintain existing ones.

 **Who We Are**

AAM is the largest program distribution group in the specialty automotive
aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
installers in the specialty automotive aftermarket. Built BY the industry, FOR
the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local
brick-and-mortar options (i.e., the shops you’ll be designing websites for).
This robust, e-commerce–ready platform lets shop owners upload product
information, including pricing, to reach consumers searching for the products
they sell. Aftermarket Websites® currently hosts more than 100 websites, and
we are adding more every month.

We’re on a mission to build the best websites for the best price for our
stores. We are a hardworking, close-knit team, and nobody in the automotive

from their mistakes, and understand the best outcomes for our customers to
ensure we keep improving. Programmers can never stop learning. There is always
new technologies and better ways to do something than the last time you did.

typically as qualified on computers as most programmers are, from time-to-time
help fix office-related computer problems and help to implement best practices
with IT.

Last, the ideal candidate is fun, respectful, kind, and does their job without
needing to be micro-managed. We don’t want to hover any more than you want us
hovering, but you’ll receive support whenever you need it.

Raka,Web Developer,"Portsmouth, NH","**Location** : This is a full-time position based in our office in Portsmouth,
New Hampshire. (Remote work is allowed but you must be able to commute to that
office regularly.)

 **Preferred** **Experience** : Mid-Level

 **Overview**

Raka is a fast growing HubSpot partner agency and we’re looking to expand our
web development team. We use our technical knowledge to work intelligently and
efficiently and to help our clients be successful, while also helping our team
grow and learn.

Web developers at Raka work collaboratively with other developers, as well as
our project managers, designers, strategists, and marketing producers to
ensure that both Raka and its clients are exceeding expectations. Our web
developers provide technical expertise to solve marketing problems as well as
leading development of websites and other HubSpot-related development
projects.

We are looking for a self-starting team player that is curious about modern
web technologies. If you are a corporate programmer who wants to be told
exactly what to do, this is not the job for you. The ideal candidate will have
a solid background in WordPress and PHP, strong front-end development skills,
as well as HubSpot related development experience.

 **What you will do (your day-to-day impact)**

  * Write clean, simple, and secure code
  * Create and maintain websites built in WordPress, HubSpot, and (occasionally) other content management systems
  * Assist in managing and adding to Raka’s code library so code can be reused for future projects
  * Collaborate in identifying and implementing technical audit work that includes development needs based on recommendations for SEO and content optimizations, creating new modules and integrations as necessary
  * Test and optimize website pages across major browsers on desktop and mobile devices
  * Perform website maintenance, including updating plugins and cleaning up code
  * Estimate and scope technical aspects of projects, as well as reviewing scopes of work regarding development needs
  * Join and participate in client calls to provide support for technical questions
  * Educate clients on process, using best practices, or specific technologies
  * Accurately track your time, both for billing purposes and to gather project cost/value metrics

 **What you will need (experience and skills)**

You will need to be fun and easygoing, but driven and willing to go the extra
mile on a job. You will also need the following skills to be successful:

  * Experience building WordPress sites from scratch (i.e. not using page builders)
  * Knowledge of the HubSpot CMS
  * Strong attention to detail, good design sense and passion for best practices
  * Strong communication and organizational skills
  * Ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously while hitting deadlines
  * Familiarity with SEO best practices as they affect development of websites
  * The ability to write semantic HTML markup and organized SCSS/CSS
  * The ability to use Git for version control
  * Proficiency with full-stack development, including front-end templates and JavaScript
  * Familiarity with WordPress dev ops on Pantheon, WPEngine, or similar platforms is a plus
  * Experience with the HubSpot API is a plus
  * Holding HubSpot certifications is a plus

If you think you’ll fit in here, great. But we don’t just want you to fit in,
we want you to expand our capabilities and our thinking. We want you to come
to the table with a different way to get the job done, or a new technology
that you may not know but will figure out overnight, or a programming solution
that might not have occurred to us.

Your previous experience and education are great, and we’d like to know about
all of it, but it’s not everything to us. Prove that you’re a fun person with
an incredible skill set as described above and the job is (probably) yours.

 **What benefits you’ll receive**

This is a full-time position with lots of perks:

  * Flexible schedules, so you can choose the hours and environment that suits you best each day.
  * Company-sponsored medical, dental, vision, and disability insurance.

specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

as helping to maintain existing ones.

 **Who We Are**

AAM is the largest program distribution group in the specialty automotive
aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
installers in the specialty automotive aftermarket. Built BY the industry, FOR
the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local
brick-and-mortar options (i.e., the shops you’ll be designing websites for).

types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and

the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local
brick-and-mortar options (i.e., the shops you’ll be designing websites for).

purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®

working in PHP, JavaScript, and React, that are responsible for helping to
build web-based software that is used by our stakeholders. They work alongside
AAM’s team of programmers to help build and develop our next big idea as well
as helping to maintain existing ones.

 **Who We Are**

AAM is the largest program distribution group in the specialty automotive
aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
installers in the specialty automotive aftermarket. Built BY the industry, FOR
the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local
brick-and-mortar options (i.e., the shops you’ll be designing websites for).

information, including pricing, to reach consumers searching for the products
they sell. Aftermarket Websites® currently hosts more than 100 websites, and

build web-based software that is used by our stakeholders. They work alongside
AAM’s team of programmers to help build and develop our next big idea as well

aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®

build web-based software that is used by our stakeholders. They work alongside
AAM’s team of programmers to help build and develop our next big idea as well
as helping to maintain existing ones.

 **Who We Are**

AAM is the largest program distribution group in the specialty automotive
aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
installers in the specialty automotive aftermarket. Built BY the industry, FOR
the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local

AAM is the largest program distribution group in the specialty automotive
aftermarket (TheAAMGroup.com). We provide services for customers of our
wholesale distribution members, which collectively operate nearly 60
warehouses across North America. We reach more than 14,000 resellers of many
types, including 4×4 shops, spray-in bedliner shops, camper top shops, speed
shops, machine shops and engine builders, fleet upfitters, and many other
specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
installers in the specialty automotive aftermarket. Built BY the industry, FOR
the industry, our sites point consumers searching for products to their local
brick-and-mortar options (i.e., the shops you’ll be designing websites for).

specialized local automotive shops. Our job at headquarters is to facilitate
purchases for our members and provide marketing tools and services to their
resellers to help them be more successful businesses—ultimately driving more
purchases to our members and the suppliers that support us.

Our fastest-growing offering is Aftermarket Websites®
(AftermarketWebsites.com): a website-building service just for retailers and
