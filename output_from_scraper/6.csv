Some of those will advance much faster than others, but they all need to happen to enable AR and VR that are so compelling that they become an integral part of our lives. The Surreal Vision group at Reality Labs Research is seeking exceptional Research Scientists to solve research challenges on the path to building future machine perception enabled technologies. The aim of this role is to develop and advance computer vision algorithms and SW systems for both real-time on-device and offline distributed large-scale scene understanding with crowdsourced egocentric data from form-factor AR glasses.
