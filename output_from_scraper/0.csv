Steadily,Software Engineer,"Austin, TX","Steadily is a venture backed insurtech startup for landlords. We've grown from
5 to 45 people in less than a year as the demand for our service continues to
rise. Our purpose is to give landlords all over the country a fast, modern
insurance buying experience and amazing customer service so they're confident
they'll have the coverage they need on a rainy day. Because of our technology
and service, our customers love being insured by us, even when they have a
claim.  
In November 2021, we announced our Series A raise of $27.8 million. Led by
Matrix Partners and Zigg Capital, we are poised to bring landlord insurance to
the forefront with cutting edge technology and exceptional people.

 **What You'll Do:**

  * Build Rating engines for calculating how much an insurance policy should cost
  * Combine property intelligence for external sources to estimate how likely a property is to flood, catch on fire, or get vandalized
  * Construct a mobile experience for people to buy insurance that is so simple/intuitive that your least-tech savvy relative with a flip-phone could use it without help
  * Create a claim app that uses phone camera and sensors to document the damage smartly

 **What You'll Bring:**

  *  **Experienced:** This isn't your first rodeo, but you may only have a couple years of experience under your belt. Most importantly you're ready to jump in and make a difference.
  *  **Builder:** You like the product-side of engineering and have thoughtful opinions on what the user experience should be. You're not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code.
  *  **Pragmatic:** Let's say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won't learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it'll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at PyCon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you'll be at home here.
  *  **Specific languages:** We don't really care if you've worked in our stack before as long as you're happy to learn it. If you're sharp enough to be on this team, you're sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly.

 **Our Stack:**

  * Python 3
  * Django
  * Postgres
  * Heroku (with full CI pipeline)
  * Redis / Celery
  * Kafka

 **Compensation:**

  * Total compensation around $200,000
  * Salary of $150,000 - $180,000 annually

 **Benefits:**

  * Equity in the company
  * Employer healthcare contribution
  * 401K
  * Flexible Time Off
  * Health (HSA or FSA), vision, and dental insurance
  * Equipment provided
  * Continued education opportunities

 **Why Steadily?**  
At Steadily you'll be able to work with other brilliant, driven teammates who
care about doing the best work of their lives. We have high expectations of
each other, but are dedicated to supporting each other in those expectations
and making Steadily a huge success.  
In order to do this, we believe in hiring top talent and encourage each team
member to actively drive the culture we want at Steadily. This includes things
like being light on processes where you manage your own workload. You know
your job best, so we won't micromanage how you get the job done (we provide
context, not control)! That said, we're also highly collaborative and go above
and beyond to make sure that we're all on the same page and have the tools we
all need to succeed.  
Working at a startup isn't easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. You'll be
able to see your actions directly impact the growth of the company, as well as
your equity's valuation, on a near-daily basis. The growth opportunity you'll
have at Steadily will also greatly increase your career trajectory, giving you
valuable experience that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.

The Bivium Group,"High Potential Junior Software Engineers - Fintech, Java, python, 3.30+GPA","Somerville, MA","REMOTE to Boston, MA area due to Covid, but afterwards, some hybrid in-office
is likely due to the highly collaborative team that was built.  
***  
Very strong salaries + bonus + amazing benefits. Must be work authorized and
emphasis on outstanding communication skills  
***  
TRULY AWESOME Fintech opportunity for Junior to Mid-level candidates - High
GPA, high potential with any strong CS code skillset

Somerville, MA - VERY HIGH Bar here

5-6 junior roles (0-5 yrs) and 1 mid-level role with lead potential (must know
Java)

Our client has beautiful, modern offices – very sharp group of candidates –
profitable and doing very well. Bivium has placed a number of junior &
associate engineers here, who LOVE the cultural, technical and business
problems!

Our client is a small company (currently 84 employees) that specializes in the
financial space, specifically in the securities settlements realm. We maintain
fairly strict hiring standards.

Our basic junior hiring guidelines are:

candidates must have an undergrad gpa of at least 3.3/4.0 and have majored in
computer science or related field (or demonstrated an interest in programming
through electives/summer jobs/etc)

candidates should have 0-7 years experience-- we take more experienced
candidates with relevant experience (eg programming in financial realm), but
as most new employees come in, in a junior role, we do not usually hire people
with > 5 yrs unrelated experience

candidates must have desire to ""learn the business""-- we market ourselves as
software developers and IT consultants who know the securities settlements
business as well as our clients do  
A bit more information about us. We consider ourselves to be ""technology
agnostic""--that is we hire people without the expectation that they are
experienced in any one technology, but they are smart enough and interested
enough to become proficient in any technology that we may require. That said,
it is certainly the case that most of our client work is in the most common
technologies--we see a lot of Java, some C, some .NET, various database
platforms).

We have even hired people without much of a programming experience to speak of
(perhaps only a class taken as an elective) but who demonstrate strong
analytical ability and a desire to learn more about software engineering.

One of the biggest distinctions between us and our competitors is the value we
place on learning the business. We view ourselves as somewhere between the
technology and the business space, and as such many of our associates complete
tasks that would traditionally fall under more of a business analyst role (in
addition to software development, not instead of). We are client facing
consultants, not just heads down coders, so written and oral communication
skills are very important and we generally hire either junior developers (0-5
yrs experience) or more experienced developers with experience relevant to our
field.

In terms of relevant experience, simply writing software for a financial
company is more relevant than unrelated industries, but not sufficient for a
more experienced hire (i.e., 5+ years). Many people do technical work at
financial firms and solve only technical problems without learning too much
about the business processes that they are supporting. The extremely rare
successful experienced candidate writes software to solve business problems
(not technical problems) in back-office areas such as settlements, clearing,
and accounting. Working in other areas such as stock borrow / stock loan,
prime brokerage, position keeping systems, etc., are also relevant.

Why someone would want to come here:

I think the shortest answer is that we are the best of all worlds. We are a
small company with a small company feel (great coworkers, no red tape,
flexible schedules, casual dress code) but do work for some of the largest
companies in the world in some of the most relevant and cutting-edge projects.
The owners of the firm place a high value on the people working for them, and
new employees will immediately have relevant work to do, and not spend their
first year merely testing someone else's code. The company is also very good
at rewarding hard work.

The Bivium Group,"High Potential Junior Software Engineers - Fintech, Java, python, 3.30+GPA","Somerville, MA","REMOTE to Boston, MA area due to Covid, but afterwards, some hybrid in-office
is likely due to the highly collaborative team that was built.  
***  
Very strong salaries + bonus + amazing benefits. Must be work authorized and
emphasis on outstanding communication skills  
***  
TRULY AWESOME Fintech opportunity for Junior to Mid-level candidates - High
GPA, high potential with any strong CS code skillset

Somerville, MA - VERY HIGH Bar here

5-6 junior roles (0-5 yrs) and 1 mid-level role with lead potential (must know
Java)

Our client has beautiful, modern offices – very sharp group of candidates –
profitable and doing very well. Bivium has placed a number of junior &
associate engineers here, who LOVE the cultural, technical and business
problems!

Our client is a small company (currently 84 employees) that specializes in the
financial space, specifically in the securities settlements realm. We maintain
fairly strict hiring standards.

Our basic junior hiring guidelines are:

candidates must have an undergrad gpa of at least 3.3/4.0 and have majored in
computer science or related field (or demonstrated an interest in programming
through electives/summer jobs/etc)

candidates should have 0-7 years experience-- we take more experienced
candidates with relevant experience (eg programming in financial realm), but
as most new employees come in, in a junior role, we do not usually hire people
with > 5 yrs unrelated experience

candidates must have desire to ""learn the business""-- we market ourselves as
software developers and IT consultants who know the securities settlements
business as well as our clients do  
A bit more information about us. We consider ourselves to be ""technology
agnostic""--that is we hire people without the expectation that they are
experienced in any one technology, but they are smart enough and interested
enough to become proficient in any technology that we may require. That said,
it is certainly the case that most of our client work is in the most common
technologies--we see a lot of Java, some C, some .NET, various database
platforms).

We have even hired people without much of a programming experience to speak of
(perhaps only a class taken as an elective) but who demonstrate strong
analytical ability and a desire to learn more about software engineering.

One of the biggest distinctions between us and our competitors is the value we
place on learning the business. We view ourselves as somewhere between the
technology and the business space, and as such many of our associates complete
tasks that would traditionally fall under more of a business analyst role (in
addition to software development, not instead of). We are client facing
consultants, not just heads down coders, so written and oral communication
skills are very important and we generally hire either junior developers (0-5
yrs experience) or more experienced developers with experience relevant to our
field.

In terms of relevant experience, simply writing software for a financial
company is more relevant than unrelated industries, but not sufficient for a
more experienced hire (i.e., 5+ years). Many people do technical work at
financial firms and solve only technical problems without learning too much
about the business processes that they are supporting. The extremely rare
successful experienced candidate writes software to solve business problems
(not technical problems) in back-office areas such as settlements, clearing,
and accounting. Working in other areas such as stock borrow / stock loan,
prime brokerage, position keeping systems, etc., are also relevant.

Why someone would want to come here:

I think the shortest answer is that we are the best of all worlds. We are a
small company with a small company feel (great coworkers, no red tape,
flexible schedules, casual dress code) but do work for some of the largest
companies in the world in some of the most relevant and cutting-edge projects.
The owners of the firm place a high value on the people working for them, and
new employees will immediately have relevant work to do, and not spend their
first year merely testing someone else's code. The company is also very good
at rewarding hard work.

Steadily,Software Engineer,"Austin, TX","Steadily is a venture backed insurtech startup for landlords. We've grown from
5 to 45 people in less than a year as the demand for our service continues to
rise. Our purpose is to give landlords all over the country a fast, modern
insurance buying experience and amazing customer service so they're confident
they'll have the coverage they need on a rainy day. Because of our technology
and service, our customers love being insured by us, even when they have a
claim.  
In November 2021, we announced our Series A raise of $27.8 million. Led by
Matrix Partners and Zigg Capital, we are poised to bring landlord insurance to
the forefront with cutting edge technology and exceptional people.

 **What You'll Do:**

  * Build Rating engines for calculating how much an insurance policy should cost
  * Combine property intelligence for external sources to estimate how likely a property is to flood, catch on fire, or get vandalized
  * Construct a mobile experience for people to buy insurance that is so simple/intuitive that your least-tech savvy relative with a flip-phone could use it without help
  * Create a claim app that uses phone camera and sensors to document the damage smartly

 **What You'll Bring:**

  *  **Experienced:** This isn't your first rodeo, but you may only have a couple years of experience under your belt. Most importantly you're ready to jump in and make a difference.
  *  **Builder:** You like the product-side of engineering and have thoughtful opinions on what the user experience should be. You're not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code.
  *  **Pragmatic:** Let's say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won't learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it'll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at PyCon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you'll be at home here.
  *  **Specific languages:** We don't really care if you've worked in our stack before as long as you're happy to learn it. If you're sharp enough to be on this team, you're sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly.

 **Our Stack:**

  * Python 3
  * Django
  * Postgres
  * Heroku (with full CI pipeline)
  * Redis / Celery
  * Kafka

 **Compensation:**

  * Total compensation around $200,000
  * Salary of $150,000 - $180,000 annually

 **Benefits:**

  * Equity in the company
  * Employer healthcare contribution
  * 401K
  * Flexible Time Off
  * Health (HSA or FSA), vision, and dental insurance
  * Equipment provided
  * Continued education opportunities

 **Why Steadily?**  
At Steadily you'll be able to work with other brilliant, driven teammates who
care about doing the best work of their lives. We have high expectations of
each other, but are dedicated to supporting each other in those expectations
and making Steadily a huge success.  
In order to do this, we believe in hiring top talent and encourage each team
member to actively drive the culture we want at Steadily. This includes things
like being light on processes where you manage your own workload. You know
your job best, so we won't micromanage how you get the job done (we provide
context, not control)! That said, we're also highly collaborative and go above
and beyond to make sure that we're all on the same page and have the tools we
all need to succeed.  
Working at a startup isn't easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. You'll be
able to see your actions directly impact the growth of the company, as well as
your equity's valuation, on a near-daily basis. The growth opportunity you'll
have at Steadily will also greatly increase your career trajectory, giving you
valuable experience that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.
