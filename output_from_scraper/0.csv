National Security Agency,Hardware/Software Design Engineer,"Fort Meade, MD","The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. With the ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, NSA needs Hardware/Software Design Engineers to design, develop, construct and test electronic hardware and software processing components. These components are typically subsystems of communication, collection, processing or analysis systems. Hardware/Software Design Engineers are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions may be an office directly supporting a technical mission or one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Information Technology Development Program (ITDP). The Resident Signals Engineering Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency. The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials. The ITDP is a three-year full-time development program designed to provide entry-level information technology specialists (that is, individuals with degrees in computer science, engineering, computer security, information systems, information technology, and related degrees and experience) the opportunity to acquire the skills and technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. In this program, participants gain a depth of knowledge in a breadth of information technology disciplines, including system/security, software engineering, software project management, and system architecture. ITDP participants work in teams and with NSA technical leaders to solve current and future challenging IT problems. The responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include: - Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment. - Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications. - Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications."

The Bivium Group,Software Engineer - early stage and self-funded by an Industry Titan,"Boston, MA","Early stage startup that is self-funded by an Industry Titan in the Consumer Facing Web / Live site space that has done this successfully several times.

Lots of Greenfields development here. No official job descriptions but they are actively looking for two full-stack Java Engineers, with a greater emphasis on the back-end: Spring Boot, Google Cloud (AWS experience is fine), container-based (Kubernetes), Python for data structure. On the front-end, they are using React, Next.JS and Node.

Current or previous Startup experience is a must.

This company is very well funded by one of the co-founders. The co-founders are made up of a highly impressive group of executives and engineers - all with industry expertise in the space they are developing this brand new consumer-facing application in. The co-founders have previously started several other companies in this space that have been successfully acquired and gone public.

This new consumer-facing application will offer *millions of consumers* the ability to research and search for a very specific topic (not finance). They are addressing an industry that is currently woefully outdated and in major need of innovation.

There are less than 10 people in the company and they are currently all working remotely. This company intends to establish its headquarters in the Cambridge, MA area sometime this year (2022). At which time they will move to a hybrid model with flexibility.

An opportunity like this does not come around often - a ground floor consumer-facing startup that is funded and led by industry experts that have very successfully done this before...several times!

Not working crazy startup hours. Everyone here has families and come from companies that offer a good work/life balance, which they intend to instill here as well.

Compensation: base salary target range is 140-160k'ish + heavy equity. Depending on the profile and experience...compensation is negotiable.
