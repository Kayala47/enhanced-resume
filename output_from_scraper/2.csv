WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and
data-driven approach.

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles
  * Experience as a technical lead within a multi-disciplinary team that includes vendors, integrators, and software engineers
  * Demonstrated track-record as a self-directed learner
  * Ability to move fast and work with incomplete information
  * Experience programming industrial robots (ABB, B&R, or ROS Industrial a plus)
  * Experience programming microcomputers and microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
  * Experience in one or more programming languages (Python or C++ a plus)
  * Comfortable with hands-on fabrication and assembly
  * Industrial electrical control panel design and assembly experience a plus
  * Software version control experience a plus
  * Computer vision experience a plus
  * Ability to dream, think, solve, and grow
  * We know that not everyone receives the same professional or educational opportunities. If there are requirements listed above that you are working towards or would like to persue and you think you would be a good fit, please apply!

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles
  * Experience as a technical lead within a multi-disciplinary team that includes vendors, integrators, and software engineers
  * Demonstrated track-record as a self-directed learner
  * Ability to move fast and work with incomplete information
  * Experience programming industrial robots (ABB, B&R, or ROS Industrial a plus)
  * Experience programming microcomputers and microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
  * Experience in one or more programming languages (Python or C++ a plus)
  * Comfortable with hands-on fabrication and assembly
  * Industrial electrical control panel design and assembly experience a plus
  * Software version control experience a plus
  * Computer vision experience a plus
  * Ability to dream, think, solve, and grow
  * We know that not everyone receives the same professional or educational opportunities. If there are requirements listed above that you are working towards or would like to persue and you think you would be a good fit, please apply!

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and
data-driven approach.

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and
data-driven approach.

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles
  * Experience as a technical lead within a multi-disciplinary team that includes vendors, integrators, and software engineers

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and
data-driven approach.

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles

  * Experience programming industrial robots (ABB, B&R, or ROS Industrial a plus)
  * Experience programming microcomputers and microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
  * Experience in one or more programming languages (Python or C++ a plus)
  * Comfortable with hands-on fabrication and assembly
  * Industrial electrical control panel design and assembly experience a plus
  * Software version control experience a plus
  * Computer vision experience a plus
  * Ability to dream, think, solve, and grow
  * We know that not everyone receives the same professional or educational opportunities. If there are requirements listed above that you are working towards or would like to persue and you think you would be a good fit, please apply!

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are seeking a curious and dedicated Lead Robotics Engineer to join our
team, an engineer with skills across mechanical, electrical and software and a
specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and
Robotics function.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

If this is you, you will be assigned to multiple concurrent programs and act
as an automation knowledge-base and resource to those teams, clearly
communicating and explaining automation and robotics capabilities/limitations
in both technical and non-technical manners. You will actively seek to
understand and interpret program objectives and you will be responsible for
translating those objectives into machine requirements and developing
solutions to meet those requirements through an iterative, collaborative and
data-driven approach.

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles
  * Experience as a technical lead within a multi-disciplinary team that includes vendors, integrators, and software engineers
  * Demonstrated track-record as a self-directed learner
  * Ability to move fast and work with incomplete information
  * Experience programming industrial robots (ABB, B&R, or ROS Industrial a plus)
  * Experience programming microcomputers and microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
  * Experience in one or more programming languages (Python or C++ a plus)
  * Comfortable with hands-on fabrication and assembly
  * Industrial electrical control panel design and assembly experience a plus
  * Software version control experience a plus
  * Computer vision experience a plus
  * Ability to dream, think, solve, and grow
  * We know that not everyone receives the same professional or educational opportunities. If there are requirements listed above that you are working towards or would like to persue and you think you would be a good fit, please apply!

specific passion for robotics. Your hands-on experiences with machine design,
system development and product integration will be the foundation for the
strategies you create to build new capabilities in our R&D setting. A track-
record of self-directed learning and collaborative problem-solving is
essential. Creating complex systems in a rapidly changing environment will
expose challenges that do not have a clear solution-path. Part of your role
will be landscaping and researching new hardware, software and controls tools
and becoming a domain expert in those areas. This is a Lead role and as such
you will be expected to plan and complete strategies that leverage your
expertise and develop team members both within and outside the Automation and

Many of the solutions you identify will be electromechanical systems which
include robotics, computer vision, sensors and microcontrollers. In early-
stage programs, you will design and build machine prototypes to test your
ideas and provide a platform for Process Engineers to define key process
variables and interactions.

As programs progress, you will continue to develop the core robotics modules
and peripheral systems through both hands-on creation and through external
partnerships you lead. You will run machine landscaping activities for
potential off-the-shelf components and sub-systems and partner with Business
Development, Legal and Procurement functions to draft agreements with
strategic partners and purchase equipment.

After you validate and train others on the new systems, you will continue to
support the teams by solving problems and upgrading the systems in
development, in-particular the software and controls components handling
motion and data acquisition. Throughout this journey you will use functional
processes and best-practices and identify improvements to these tools that can
enable the team to work more efficiently.

WHO YOU WILL WORK WITH

You will be working in a premier R&D facility with a dedicated machine shop,
testing lab and product creation team to assist you. You'll have support in
embracing the hands-on parts of your role (fabricating, assembling, coding,
testing) with a growth-mindset approach and a hunger to learn. You will also
partner with Technical Program Managers, Process Engineers and Technicians as
your project core-team members as well as Materials and Software experts where
appropriate. Collaborating with these functions and standing-up new
capabilities in Innovation rewards system-based thinking and interdisciplinary
problem-solving. You won't have all the answers, but you'll be able to ask
good questions across a variety of subject-areas.

  

WHAT YOU BRING

  * Bachelor's or higher degree in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Mechatronics or similarly related engineering field or a combination of relevant education, experience, and training
  * 5+ years of applied experience in system design, integration of hardware solutions, robotics, or other mechatronics roles
