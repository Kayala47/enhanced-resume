Job description
Your main responsibilities will be to improve/expand/maintain the hardware/EE aspect of our embedded systems: design or re-design current circuits to accommodate new product features and projects, write embedded firmware in C (low-level drivers), assemble and test prototypes, bring-up boards, debug and fix problems. You will work closely with software and controls engineers, as well as with our mechanical engineering team. Work balance: 65% hardware, 35% firmware. Since our embedded systems are used directly by people (wearable robots), reliability and predictability are key. This is a fast-paced environment: it’s not uncommon to have an idea on a Monday, CAD it right away, write firmware and test code while the PCBs are being fabricated, hand assemble and test everything by the end of the week."

Your main responsibilities will be to improve/expand/maintain the hardware/EE aspect of our embedded systems: design or re-design current circuits to accommodate new product features and projects, write embedded firmware in C (low-level drivers), assemble and test prototypes, bring-up boards, debug and fix problems. You will work closely with software and controls engineers, as well as with our mechanical engineering team. Work balance: 65% hardware, 35% firmware. Since our embedded systems are used directly by people (wearable robots), reliability and predictability are key. This is a fast-paced environment: it’s not uncommon to have an idea on a Monday, CAD it right away, write firmware and test code while the PCBs are being fabricated, hand assemble and test everything by the end of the week."
