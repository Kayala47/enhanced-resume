enormous reduction in energy costs and megatons of reduction in GHG emissions.

making each facility more efficient for our customers.

backgrounds. We seek to build a diverse pool of applicants that will help to

  *  **Coding:** Experience writing automation for Linux in at least one general-purpose language, such as Ansible (YAML), Python, bash, Groovy, Javascript, etc. We do _not_ need full blown object-oriented programming for this role, but you must know Git - pulling, committing, pushing, creating and reviewing pull requests, resolving merge conflicts, branching methodologies, rebasing, etc.
  *  **CICD** : Experience creating and troubleshooting CICD pipelines, preferably in Jenkins.
  *  **Cyber security:** Knowledgeable in any of the following: SonarQube, DISA STIGs, NIST RMF, zero trust, secure-by-design, Splunk, ACAS, encryption, PKI, identity management, etc.

  * You've worked in an Agile environment. You thrive on iteration. You make opportunities to bring value sooner rather than later.
  * You value data-driven decisions. You are always looking for opportunities to quickly produce the right data to make decisions quickly.
