Ideas

Front-end
- CLI situation. minimum viable product
- Procedure:
    - what type of job are you looking for?
    - loading screen (completion of scraping, completion of ner)
    - load in trained model: don't do it for user

    - scrape top 5 jobs and run the model on those
    - keep the tags in an array, and present them nicely to the user
    - (lower priority) sort the skills somehow - probably by frequency of use

Back-end
- suite of functions to be called by front-end
- scrape 5 jobs using the keyword
- return an array of JobListings

Interface

- scraper 
scrape5(desc: str)

class JobListing:

    vars:
    - skills[]
    - attributes[]
    - job title
    - company name

- front-end


Demo
- take a video of a working operation instead of doing it live
